# 🥧 Clicker
**This is an auto clicker coded in 100% Python.**
## Key
```
🟢 - Bypasses well (recommended)
🟡 - Bypasses decently (risky)
🔴 - Does not bypass at all (DONT USE)
```
## Bypasses
We utilize modules like win32api, which replace C++ and c#'s Windows API.  This has been tested on the following anti-cheat test servers.


* **Karhu AC** - 🟢 (note: just turn on the block hit option if higher cps)
* **NCP** - 🟢 (note:  11-14 CPS should be fine, 15+ flagged when tested, block hit optional.  AC flagged when I was butterflying 15+ cps 💀)

## Other Servers
* hypixel.net - 🟡 prolly bypasses i havent tried but it has shit anti cheat just add in ur own randomizations or some shit
